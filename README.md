This repository contains various professional and personal projects in which I utilize various statistical techniques to analyze the data. Listed below are the main projects with short descriptions and a link to preview an R notebook. 

Feelings and Vote Choice (Classification)
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gcm1991/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Feelings%20%26%20Vote%20Choice%20(Classification).nb.html

For this project I am interested in how much feelings towards the political parties matter when it comes to presidential vote choice. I am interested in comparing the impact of feelings to more traditional variables such as policy preferences. Taking data from the 2016 ANES I run several logistic regression  models in which I attempt to predict a respondents vote choice based on their 1) feelings 2) policy preferences 3) and demographics.
